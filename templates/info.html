                        and through your
                        national and local public health authority. Most people who become infected experience mild
                        illness and recover,
                        but it can be more severe for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the

                        <p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with
                            soap and
                            water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub
                            kills viruses
                            that may be on your hands.</p></div>

                        <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
                            sneezing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from
                            their nose or
                            mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
                            including the COVID-19
                            virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                            contaminated, hands can
                            transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body
                            and can make you

                            covering your mouth and
                            nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used
                            tissue
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
                            protect the people
                            around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p></div>
